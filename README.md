# nucleon.css

Currently in its developing stage, nucleon.css is a small, light weight CSS starter kit for responsive grid layout and typography. It includes small utilities and basic reset to help you kick start any project.

All the components have been put in different files, so you can use only the required ones.
Whereas nucleon.css combines all into one.
A minified version is preferable if you don't have to make many changes, but simple version can be used to customize stuff.
